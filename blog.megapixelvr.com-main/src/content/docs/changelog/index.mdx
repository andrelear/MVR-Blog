We just released the first development preview of xxx, our first fully-componentized, batteries-included application UI kit for xxx — real components with thoughtfully designed APIs that build on each other to create a real component architecture, the same way we’d do it in a real application.

There’s a lot more to come, but we’re releasing it today so you can play with it right away as we continue to build new components and find ways to make it an even better experience.
